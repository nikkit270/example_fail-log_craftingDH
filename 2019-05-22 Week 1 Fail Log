# Week 1 fail log
I am having a tough time understanding how to navigate myself around the websites that we must complete our work on and complete our annotations. I am very confused and I received help today from a collegue in this class and I feel more confident as to what I am doing. I understand the goal of the course and I enjoy completing the readings and commenting on them, however, 'forking' into github and hypothesis and so on is very difficult to nativgate through.
